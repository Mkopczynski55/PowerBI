# PowerBI
💡 This repository contains the files and resources for my Power BI projects. It includes Power BI Desktop files (.pbix), data sources, and related scripts for data modeling, transformation, and visualization. The goal of these projects is to analyze and visualize business data, providing actionable insights through interactive dashboards and reports.
